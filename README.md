# Premove-Chess
A variant of Chess where every move must be a premove - you don't know what move your opponent made before you decide yours. If you make an illegal move, you lose!

This is a complete web app, front to back, that allows two players to play this variant I invented. It's a bit finicky, it only handles one game, and it's very light on the front end, but it's a workable demonstration of concept.
