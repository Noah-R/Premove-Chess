# Premove-Chess
A variant of Chess where every move must be a premove - you don't know what move your opponent made before you decide yours

Current dependencies are:

    express.js

    body-parser

    python-chess: https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/

    chessboard-element: https://github.com/justinfagnani/chessboard-element

To Do:

    Backend
        Will basically be running premovechess.py or a js translation
        Will mainly interface with Express routing through getMove()
        Will need some modifications to fully match
        Will probably reference https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/Online-Chess
    
    Make everything actually work correctly together

    Deploy, through Heroku
