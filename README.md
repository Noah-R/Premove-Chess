# Premove-Chess
A variant of Chess where every move must be a premove - you don't know what move your opponent made before you decide yours

Current dependencies are:

    express.js

    python-chess: https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/

    chessboard-element: https://github.com/justinfagnani/chessboard-element

To Do:

    Routing, will basically just send game updates back and forth, will probably reference https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/Online-Chess

    Web Server will basically be running premovechess.py, which will mainly interface through getMove() 
    but will need some modifications to fully match 
    
    Deploy, through Heroku
